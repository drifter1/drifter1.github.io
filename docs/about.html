    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        I'm currently studying for a master's degree in Computer Science.
        Still as a pre-graduate student I got into cryptocurrencies and started posting on Steemit.
        And I'm still posting articles, be it tutorials for Languages and specific Libraries,
        which are related to Computer Science, or Mathematics and Physics... I got you covered!
